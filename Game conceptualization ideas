Player shown a regex ie. a*b+
Player has inventory with start state(s), transition state(s), and accept state(s)
Player drags states onto play area, states get auto-named when placed
Tap on a state and drag - starts transition arrow
    - release drag on state, points arrow to that state, opens popup to choose element(s) to attach to arrow
    - drag out of state and then back to same state - creates loop arrow, then opens popup to choose element(S)
    - release drag on open space - cancels arrow
Run button - generates test cases, states on board light up as test string gets stepped through?
Display congrats message if all test strings are accepted (or not accepted as appropriate)

Obviously first levels are super easy, tutorial?
DFAs to start, NFAs introduced after x levels?

Get all that to work, add increased difficulty, flip to writing regex based on DFA/NFA, etc

All just ideas, what do you think?
